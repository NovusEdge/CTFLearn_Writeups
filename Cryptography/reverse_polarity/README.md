### CTF Statement:
```txt
I got a new hard drive just to hold my flag, but I'm afraid that it rotted. What do I do? The only thing I could get off of it was this:

01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101
```

Since we've been given a simple binary to decode into a flag that's in ASCII form, we'll first convert the given binary into it's hex equivalent. After doing this, we'll need to convert the resultant hex into ASCII text.

To do so, we can simply use [this website](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/index.html)
